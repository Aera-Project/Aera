Welcome to the official documentation for our **Autonomous AI Superagent**. This guide provides an overview of the system’s core concepts, mechanics, security, and economic structure.

## 🚀 Overview

Our platform is a **decentralized autonomous AI superagent** that evolves dynamically based on community contributions. By participating, users help shape the agent’s cognitive development and operational behavior.

## 📌 Core Concepts

- **System Architecture** – A network of interconnected components enabling AI-driven decision-making.
- **Access Requirements** – Users must maintain a threshold of **100,000 tokens** for active participation.

## ⚙️ System Mechanics

- **Participation Framework** – Users contribute traits to the AI via a structured submission process.
- **Contribution Guidelines** – Community-voted selections determine final AI integrations.
- **Time-Based Integration** – A **24-hour cycle** governs the AI’s evolution and trait adoption.

## 🧠 Technical Foundation

- **Processing Architecture** – A **13-billion parameter neural network** drives decision-making.
- **Learning Framework** – AI trained on **1M+ curated interactions** for high adaptability.

## 🔒 Security Framework

- **Authentication** – Secure login via **Phantom Wallet integration**.
- **Data Management** – Access and privacy controls based on **token holdings**.

## 💰 Economic Structure

- **Engagement Requirements** – A **100,000-token** minimum ensures commitment.
- **Early Adoption Benefits** – **5% of total token supply** allocated to early adopters.

## 📡 API Usage

### Example: Python
```python
import requests

API_URL = "https://api.example.com/path"
HEADERS = {"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY", "Content-Type": "application/json"}

response = requests.post(API_URL, json={"param1": "value1"}, headers=HEADERS)
print(response.json())
